Versioning: [Major build number].[Minor build number].[Revision].[Package]
 Major build number: This indicates a major milestone in a program so it should be incremented when going from alpha to beta, release and then major updates.
 - Includes major changes to the actual html/css, as opposed to textual content that is being displayed on the site (new layout/buttons etc.).

 Minor build number: Used for feature updates, large bug fixes, etc..
 - Includes minor changes to the actual html/css, as opposed to textual content that is being displayd on the site (new layout/buttons etc.).

 Revision: Minor alterations on existing features, small bug fixes, etc..
 - This heavily includes changes or additions to text that is being displayed on the site.

 Package: The code stays the same, external library changes or asset file updates.
 - Additions or changes to any image, video or vector file.

 If any of these changes occur, the number in the specific spot shall be increased by one, no matter how much has changed; this is due to the fact that the version number is already divided into big
 and small change parts.
 Combined changes roll over to the most significant change. If the minor build number gets increased, the revision and package both reset to 0.
